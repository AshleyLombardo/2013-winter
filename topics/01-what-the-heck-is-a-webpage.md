Well, in it's most basic form, a webpage is just a simple text file. You can write something in any text editor - anything at all, save it as a `.htm` or `.html` file, and open it up with a browser of your choice.

It may not look very pretty, but every browser will render it the same - which sounds like a legit webpage to me.

Go ahead and give that a shot.
