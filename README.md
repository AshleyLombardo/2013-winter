# I heard you like webpages.

So I made a webpage inside a webpage, so you can learn about webpages while you make webpages.

I'm going to try and keep everything simple and avoid the technical jargon. Let's just dive in.


## What the heck is a webpage?

Well, in it's most basic form, a webpage is just a text file. You can write something in any text editor, save it as a `.htm` or `.html` file, and open it up with a browser of your choice.

It may not look very pretty, but every browser will render it the same - which sounds like a legit webpage to me.

Go ahead and give that a shot.
