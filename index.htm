<h1>Love for the Game</h1>

<p>There are many amazing world-wide sports, however there is nothing like the game of football, or soccer. Soccer has evolved over time and has grown to be an international sensation. Soccer is a game which teaches team work, hard work, and competition. The feeling of watching or even better, be on a team is an amazing feeling. Soccer brings the world together because of its popularity and love of the game.</p>
