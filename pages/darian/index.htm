        <h2>EID100 - Web Page</h2>
        <p>I'm Darian, I'm a third year theatre production student. I'm from a really small city on the east coast. I love photography, coffee, owls and travelling.</p>
	<p><i>"And when people try to minimize your pain they are doing you a disservice. And when you try to minimize your own pain you're doing yourself a disservice. Don't do that. The truth is that it hurts because it's real. It hurts because it mattered. And that's an important thing to acknowledge to yourself. But that doesn't mean that it won't end, it won't get better. Because it will." - John Green</i></p>
